## Environment Setup

### Getting the repository

Use `git` to clone the repository to your Linux environment. This can be done using:

```bash
git clone ist-git@git.uwaterloo.ca:ece621-w24/project/h3trinh-pd1.git && cd h3trinh-pd1 && ./install-hooks.sh
```
The `./install-hooks.sh` command installs a pre-push hook in your local repository to remind you to add/clear files before pushing.

### Setup of simulators and environment variables

Go to the root of the project repository and execute the command `source env.sh`.
You should get the information similar to the following.
Note that you will need to perform this operation every time you use a different `bash` session.
Otherwise, the scripts will not be able to locate the files.

```bash
$ source env.sh
===== Computer Architecture Course Environment Setup =====
Important: this script should be used as `source env.sh` and should only be used in bash
Project Root ($PROJECT_ROOT):		/home/your/path/to/repo
verilator Version ($VERILATOR_VERSION):	 Verilator 4.210 2021-07-07 rev v4.210
Vivado Version ($VIVADO_VERSION): 	 Vivado v2022.1 (64-bit)
===== Computer Architecture Course Environment Done  =====
```

If the script is unable to locate the verilator or vivado version, the corresponding line will be empty.

## Memory Module Specification

In this PD, you will create a "magic" main memory module that is byte-addressable.
That is, the memory should support addressing individual bytes (8 bits).
The main memory module is to be modelled at the behavioural level.
This means that it does not have to be synthesizable.

The memory will have the following ports:
  - `clock` (1 bit)
  - `address` (32 bits)
  - `data_in` (32 bits): The data to be written into the memory at the provided address.
  - `data_out` (32 bits): The data response from the main memory to the address provided.
  - `read_write` (1 bit): Whether the memory is being read from or written to, use 0 to denote a read and 1 to denote a write.

We provide you with a macro named `MEM_DEPTH` which defines the depth of the memory module in bytes.
By default the value of `MEM_DEPTH` is `32'd1048576`.
Whenever a 32-bit address is supplied on the address line, the memory module should return 32-bit data on `data_out`.
Memory should use little-endian ordering.
The program instructions start at address `0x01000000` meaning that we would start fetching instructions from this address and data would follow the instruction segment.
Note that the program counter (PC) default starting address should be `0x01000000`.
The main memory should return the 32-bit data word within one clock cycle.
To do this, make the reads combinational, and the writes sequential as discussed in class.
This means that on a read operation, the output on `data_out` has the value at the specified `address` in the same clock cycle.
However, on a write operation, the new value is only available to be read in the next clock cycle.
We recommend that you read it using `readmemh()` into a temporary array, and then copy it within the `initial` block into the main memory array.
Note that `MEM_PATH` can be used as one parameter of `readmemh()`.

## Benchmarks

We will be using the [rv32-benchmarks](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ece621-w24/rv32-benchmarks) to test your design.
In order to load the binaries, you should use an `initial` block to read the `.x` file.
The path to the `.x` file will be provided to you as a macro of string named `MEM_PATH`.
You can set this macro when you run `make` to test different benchmarks.
We also provide a macro `LINE_COUNT` to identify the number of lines within `MEM_PATH`.

## PD Module

You will need to implement some fetch stage logic in the `pd` module in `design/code/pd.v`.
You need to drive the PC using sequential logic.
The PC must be reset to the starting address (`0x01000000`) and increment by four each clock cycle.
You will also need to instantiate the `imemory` module here.

## Probes

As with PD0, you need to fill in `design/signals.h` with your signal names in `design/code/pd.v` to wire up the probes:

```verilog
`define F_PC                ???
`define F_INSN              ???
```

- `F_PC` is the 32-bit `address` input port, which acts as the PC for the fetch stage.
- `F_INSN` is the 32-bit `data_out` output port, which acts as the instruction for the fetch stage.

## Tests

We provide simple tests that test for signal presence and basic timing correctness.

- `test_pd`: Tests for basic signal presence and to generate trace files (see below).  Note that `test_pd` does not check correctness properties, so it does not output `Test passed` even if it successfully completes.
- `test_pre_check`: Tests the initialization properties of your `imemory`
- `test_imemory`: Tests some simple correctness properties of your memory module.

To run these tests, go to `verif/scripts` and use the following command:

```bash
make -s run [TEST=<test_name>] [MEM_PATH=<mem_path>]
```

If you do not supply a `TEST`, the command will default to the `test_pd` test.

We will be using these trace files throughout the project to output signal values at each pipeline stage every clock cycle.
For PD1, we will output information from the fetch stage only.
If it doesn't encounter any errors, the `test_pd` test will generate a `.trace` file for a given benchmark located in `verif/sim/verilator/test_pd/`.
This file will consist of lines formatted as `[F] pc_address content` in hexadecimal format.
For example, the first line of output of `verif/sim/verilator/test_pd/rv32ui-p-addi.trace` should be `[F] 01000000 00000093`.

For PD1, we provide you with the first 400 lines of the golden trace files for the individual instruction benchmarks in `verif/golden`.
Make sure that your output lines up with these.

## Testbench

Apart from the tests we provided, you may write your own testbenches.
This is not required, but may help you find new bugs that the other tests cannot find.

You need to place your testbench in a module called `top`, located in `verif/tests/` (e.g. `verif/tests/test_my_pd.v`).
You may refer to `test_pd.v` and extend from that file.
By creating `test_my_pd.v`, you will be able to run the test in `verif/scripts` using `make run TEST=test_my_pd`.
Make sure that your design does not report any warning during compilation.

We provide the verilator `verif/tests/test_pd.cpp` that drives your testbench. 
However, your testbench should not depend on any modifications to the `test_pd.cpp`.

## Troubleshooting your Design

You may be tempted to rely on `$display()` tasks to debug your design.
However, it can be difficult to determine when signals change value with these statements.
Instead, you can plot the waves using `gtkwave`.
We have provided a Makefile target to do this:

```bash
make waves [MEM_PATH=<mem_path>]
```

You can edit `verif/scripts/waves.tcl` to automatically add specific signals to your screen, group signals together, set colours and zoom level, etc.
If you would like to do this Appendix C in the project deliverables document on LEARN.

## Submission

The following are deliverables for PD1.

1. Write a main memory module behavioural model as described above.
2. Implement the fetch stage in the `design/code/pd.v` module. Instantiate your `imemory` module and drive the program counter.
3. Complete the probe macros in `design/signals.h`. If you added any files, be sure to add them to `verif/scripts/design.f`.
4. Make sure that your design passes `test_imemory`, `test_pd`, and `test_pre_check` without any error or warning.
5. Make sure that your trace files are consistent with those in `verif/golden`.

We will expect that your memory module works with any input benchmark that fits the size specifications.

When you are finished, remember to commit and push your changes to your GitLab repository.
Be sure to execute `git add <PATH(S) TO NEW FILE(S)>` if you add any new files before committing your changes.

```bash
git commit -am "<message>"
git push origin master
```

Your most recently pushed code prior to the deadline will be treated as your submission when we grade.
