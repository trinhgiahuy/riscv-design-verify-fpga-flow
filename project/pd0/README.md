# PD0: Environment Setup and Tutorial

This document guides you through the setup for the environment and the steps for submission.

**Deadline**: Sunday, Jan. 21st, 2024 at 11:59 PM

**Weight**: 0% of total lab grade

## Prerequisites

### Option 1
We recommend using one of the following ECE Linux servers, in which all necessary packages and simulators are set up properly for every user.
You should be able to log in using your UWaterloo ID and password.
If you are off-campus, you will need to [set up VPN](https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISTSERV/pages/42588307544/About+the+Virtual+Private+Network+VPN) to access the servers.

```bash
ssh -X eceubuntu.uwaterloo.ca
```

If you are using Windows, we recommend installing [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as an SSH client.
If you are using MacOS, you may need to configure [XQuartz](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apple-osx-mountain-lion-mavericks-install-xquartz-server/).

### Option 2

It is possible to install some or all of tools on your local machine.

1. You will need a Linux bash environment to execute the tests. Ubuntu or other Linux distributions should work fine.
2. You will need `make` installed in your distribution to execute the tests.
3. You will need `git` to clone the repository.
4. You will need `verilator` to properly run your code. Refer to the lab manual on [LEARN](https://learn.uwaterloo.ca) for installation guidelines on `verilator`. Make sure that they are present in your `$PATH` environment variable so that it can be detected.

## Paths

Throughout the project, we will frequently refer to files and directories in the repository. All directory and file names are **relative to the repository root**.
For example, the location of this README is `./README.md`.

## Environment Setup

### Getting the repository

If you have not done already, use git to clone the repository to your Linux environment. This can be done using:

```bash
git clone ist-git@git.uwaterloo.ca:ece621-w24/project/h3trinh-pd0.git && cd h3trinh-pd0 && ./install-hooks.sh
```

The `./install-hooks.sh` command installs a pre-push hook in your local repository to remind you to add/clear files before pushing.

### Setup of simulators and environment variables

Go to the root of the project repository and execute the command `source env.sh`.
You should get the information similar to the following.
Note that you will need to perform this operation every time you use a different `bash` session.
Otherwise, the scripts will not be able to locate the files.

```bash
$ source env.sh
===== Computer Architecture Course Environment Setup =====
Important: this script should be used as `source env.sh` and should only be used in bash
Project Root ($PROJECT_ROOT):		/home/your/path/to/repo
verilator Version ($VERILATOR_VERSION):	 Verilator 4.210 2021-07-07 rev v4.210
Vivado Version ($VIVADO_VERSION): 	 Vivado v2022.1 (64-bit)
===== Computer Architecture Course Environment Done  =====
```

If the script is unable to locate the verilator or vivado version, the corresponding line will be empty.

## Test Run
After setting up the environment, we go through a test run to make sure everything is set up.

Navigate to the `verif/scripts` testing directory with `cd`. Run the following command.

```bash
$ make -s run
Verilator Compilation
Verilator Run
[1] %Error: test_pd0.v:98: Assertion failed in TOP.top.reg_and_arst_test: 
[PD0] Signal(s) for exercise 3.3 is not defined in signals.h
%Error: /home/your/path/to/repo/verif/tests/test_pd0.v:98: Verilog $stop
Aborting...
Aborted (core dumped)
make: *** [Makefile.verilator:37: run] Error 134
```

Since the code for exercise 3.3 and 3.4 is not done, it reports a fatal error that the tests are not successful.
This is expected.
Note the `-s` option of the `make` command that suppresses some console output from showing up.
You may try `make run` to see what is happening.
If you get very noisy results, look for the `[PD0]` prefix in the output.

## Adding code

### Directory Structure

It is not easy to see upfront how the structure of the code works.
However, the structure will remain the same for all PDs.

There are 3 types of file that you will be modifying, where an asterisk (`*`) represents any string:
1. The **Signal Probes** in `design/signals.h`
2. The **Design Files** in `design/code/*.v`
3. The **File List** in `verif/scripts/design.f`

When testing, we compile your **Design Files** defined in the **File List**, then drive and read the **Signal Probes** in our testbench to determine whether 
your implementation is correct.

You should **NOT** modify any other file in the directory.
We will replace these files with the originals when grading.
Any changes you make will not have an effect when submitted.

### Walk-through

We take the `assign_and` as an example to show you how it is added to the project.
You will need to go through the same process when adding your modules.

#### Step 1. The design
The `assign_and.v` is located at `design/code/assign_and.v`.
It implements an and gate with combinational logic:

```verilog
module assign_and(
  input wire x,
  input wire y,
  output wire z
);
  assign z = x & y;
endmodule // and_assign
```

#### Step 2. Instantiate the design
The module `pd0` located at `design/code/pd0.v` shows how you instantiate the `assign_and` module as a sub-module.

```verilog
module pd0(
  input clock,
  input reset
);
  /* demonstrating the usage of assign_and */
  reg assign_and_x;
  reg assign_and_y;
  wire assign_and_z;
  assign_and assign_and_0 (
    .x(assign_and_x),
    .y(assign_and_y),
    .z(assign_and_z)
  );
  /* other code ... */
endmodule
```

The module `pd0` is your top design. 
You may have as many levels of sub-modules as you want and you will have the freedom to specify their input/output ports.
Your top module, however, must only consists of two input ports `clock` and `reset`, as presented above.

Also notice how the input and output ports of `assign_and_0` are driven by wires and regs.
These are the probes that you provide for us so that we can control the input to your modules freely to test them.
You may also want to write your own testbenches to drive these signals to make sure you submission is correct.

#### Step 3. Edit the Probe File for probes

For each PD, we provide a list of probes that you should provide for us to manipulate your design.

The probe file is located at `design/signals.h`.

```verilog
`define ASSIGN_AND_X  assign_and_x
`define ASSIGN_AND_Y  assign_and_y
`define ASSIGN_AND_Z  assign_and_z
```

A probe is simply a macro definition where the macro names (`ASSIGN_AND_*`) are the names we will be using and the macro values (`assign_and_*`) are the signals within your design.
The macro values normally should be the name of and/or path to a wire or a reg.
The macro values you provide are relative to the top module.

For each PD, we will provide you with a list of probes that you should fill in and a simple test that you should pass so that the type of the probes (wire or reg) should be correct.

#### Step 4. Edit the Probe File for top module name
You will also need to define the `TOP_MODULE` name of your design in the `design/signals.h` so that it can be instantiated properly.

```verilog
/* some other code */

// ----- design -----
`define TOP_MODULE               pd0
// ----- design -----
```

#### Step 5. Edit the File List
You will need to update the design file list at `verif/scripts/design.f`.

Simply include all the files that you use in `design/code`.
Also, DO NOT include more than the code you use as it might cause errors.

#### Step 6. Run the tests
With the `env.sh` sourced properly, go to `verif/scripts/` and use `make run`.

## Submission

The following are deliverables for PD0.
Note that PD0 is optional and has a 0% weight on the overall lab grade.
However, we will check any submissions if you would like feedback after completing it.

1. Read through the Verilog Tutorial document on [LEARN](https://learn.uwaterloo.ca).
2. Complete the code for Exercises 3.3 and 3.4 by filling in the `reg_and_arst` and `reg_and_reg` modules in this repo.
3. Add your responses to Exercises 3.1 to 3.4 on [Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/).

You should see the following output when everything is working correctly:

```bash
$ make -s run
Verilator Compilation
Verilator Run
[PD0] No error encountered
- /home/your/path/to/repo/verif/tests/test_pd0.v:19: Verilog $finish
```

Remember to commit and push your changes to your GitLab repository.

```bash
git commit -am "<message>"
git push origin master
```

Your most recently pushed code prior to the deadline will be treated as your submission when we grade.
